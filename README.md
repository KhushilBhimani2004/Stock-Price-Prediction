**Stock Price Prediction with LSTM**

Developed a comprehensive stock price prediction application using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, integrated with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface. The application allows users to upload a CSV file with historical stock prices or fetch data directly from Yahoo Finance.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Fetching:** Utilized yFinance API to retrieve up to 5 years of historical stock data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented Min-Max scaling for normalizing stock prices.
- **Model Creation:** Built an LSTM model using TensorFlow, designed to predict future stock prices based on past trends.
- **Visualization:** Employed Plotly to create interactive visualizations, including line charts for open vs. close prices, high vs. low prices, and candlestick charts for detailed stock analysis.
- **User Interaction:** Enabled user input for stock ticker symbols and time steps, with buttons to train the model and make predictions.

**Technologies Used:** Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, yFinance, MinMaxScaler, LSTM, Plotly

**Relevance to Job Description:**
- Demonstrated strong **quantitative and analytical skills** by developing a data-driven prediction model.
- Applied **core Java and OOP skills** in designing the model's architecture.
- Showcased proficiency in **data structures and algorithms** through efficient data processing and model training.
- Gained insight into the **finance domain** by working on a project focused on stock market analysis, aligning with the finance focus area of the job profile.

This project highlights my ability to combine technical skills with domain knowledge, making me a strong candidate for roles involving software development, data analysis, and financial technology.
